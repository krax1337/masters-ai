A stylized, slightly surreal black-and-white illustration featuring a rat standing on a windowsill, looking outside through a tall window. The cityscape outside includes rooftops with TV antennas and a faint outline of buildings in the distance. A small fly or insect is visible near the top right of the window. The scene is quiet and introspective. Above the window, in bold text, it says "GRAZHDANSKAYA OBORONA" in red and "OPTIMISM" in orange. The illustration has a nostalgic, (pencil-drawn or sketchbook feel), evoking a somber yet hopeful mood, depression mood.

A vibrant, comic-style digital illustration of a confident white rapper character dressed like a superhero. He wears a rich maroon and gold outfit with detailed textures, giving off a regal yet urban vibe. His head is slightly leaned to the left, adding a casual, self-assured attitude to his pose. He has light skin, a trimmed beard, and a serious, intense facial expression.

His oversized sunglasses are designed to look like a retro boombox, colored in deep red and yellow with black speaker details and lightning bolt accents in bright yellow. Around his neck are chunky gold chains, one featuring a large medallion that says "NOIZE MC" in bold black letters with a yellow outline, styled like graffiti. His hands are raised in a hip-hop hand gesture, with rings and jewelry glinting in metallic gold tones.

Exploding from his head is a vivid collage of purple and violet imagery, including cassette tapes, skulls, faces, symbols, and mechanical parts—forming a chaotic "thought cloud" or afro-like burst that represents musical and cultural rebellion. The background is a beige canvas with rough black paint strokes and a dark city skyline silhouette in the background.

Additional elements include a Parental Advisory sticker in black and white on the bottom left. The illustration is bold and high-contrast, bursting with color, energy, and defiant creative spirit.

A fun, chaotic, retro-style illustrated movie poster inspired by 1980s action-comedy aesthetics. In the center foreground is a bright red sports car, slightly tilted, with dramatic speed lines and motion blur, giving the impression it's racing straight out of the image. The car is partially crashing through a checkered racing flag, symbolizing a wild race. A white road sign behind the car reads "MAXIMUM SPEED 55."

Surrounding the car in a loose V-formation are a diverse group of energetic and eccentric characters. They include: a suave man in a tuxedo with a cocky grin, a glamorous woman with 80s-style voluminous hair, a muscular guy in a mechanic's outfit flexing, a priest-looking character holding a steering wheel, a pair of ladies in tight racing suits, and a few comedic sidekicks in wacky disguises. All characters are mid-action or striking bold, exaggerated poses, with expressive facial features.

Above them, actor names are displayed in colorful, retro fonts, staggered across the top—each name in a different bright color like red, orange, blue, or pink. The background is mostly white, with a light gradient, emphasizing the cartoonish energy and over-the-top style. Below the car is the movie title in bold red and orange gradient block letters: "**THE CANNONBALL RUN**," followed by a cheeky tagline in black text: _"You'll root for them all... but you'll never guess who wins."_

The overall mood is comedic, energetic, and adventurous—full of 1980s charm and pop culture flair.

A dark, dystopian sci-fi book cover design. The background is pitch black with a gritty, textured surface that gives a sense of decay and danger. Dominating the lower portion of the image is a close-up of a menacing gas mask, rendered in sharp, hyper-realistic detail. The mask's large, round eye lenses reflect a ghostly, apocalyptic scene—ruins or flickers of distant fire—evoking a post-nuclear world. Thick, flexible breathing tubes extend from the sides of the mask, disappearing into shadow.

Above the mask, the title reads "METRO 2033" in large, bold text. "METRO" is in cracked, distressed red letters with a rugged, battle-worn texture. Below it, "2033" is written in a cold, digital-style white font with uneven lines, adding to the bleak tone. Above the title, the author's name "DMITRY GLUKHOVSKY" is printed in small, minimalist white text.

At the bottom of the image, in clean, thin sans-serif font, it says: "THE NOVEL BEHIND METRO: LAST LIGHT" — tying it to the video game adaptation. The overall composition conveys isolation, survival, and a haunting atmosphere beneath the ruins of a once-civilized world, drawing heavily on themes of post-apocalyptic fiction and underground survival.
